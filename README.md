MFF notifier
========================
I was tired of refreshing my tutors' websites so I created this automated script.

When there is a change on any website, the changed content is sent to given email adresses.

(Cron is used to check for changes every hour).

Tools used
-------------------------
Script is build as a [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) bundle.

[PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/) also came in handy.
